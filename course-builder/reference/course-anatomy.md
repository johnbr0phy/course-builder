# Course Anatomy

The exact structure, formats, and rules every generated course follows. This is
the distilled blueprint behind the AIPM and Dynamic Workflows courses.

## File structure

```
<slug>-course/
├── README.md          # overview, quick start, session list, prerequisites
├── CLAUDE.md          # instructor: setup, session flow, commands, quiz rules, guardrails
├── LESSONS.md         # full plans for every session (real content, not stubs)
├── SOURCE.md          # canonical source material — lessons stay accurate to this
├── index.html         # (optional) browsable homepage, self-contained
└── templates/
    ├── user.json          # learner profile (copied to course root on setup)
    ├── progress.json      # per-session status, checkpoints, quiz scores
    ├── PROGRESS.md        # human-readable checkmark view
    └── MY_<THING>.md      # the learner's running example → capstone artifact
```

On first run the instructor copies the four templates into working files at the
course root (`user.json`, `progress.json`, `PROGRESS.md`, `MY_<THING>.md`).

`<slug>` is a kebab-case name from the topic (e.g. `dynamic-workflows-course`).
`MY_<THING>` is named after the running example (`MY_PRODUCT`, `MY_WORKFLOW`,
`MY_DATASET`, `MY_PAPER`, …).

## SOURCE.md

The authoritative material, reproduced faithfully (verbatim if the user supplied
it). Open with a short note: *"This is the source of truth. If a lesson and this
file disagree, this file wins."* Every lesson and quiz answer must trace back here.

## LESSONS.md — the lesson format

Top of file: name the lesson format and list the cross-cutting guardrails the
instructor enforces in every exercise. Then a section per phase, a subsection per
session. **Every session includes all six parts:**

1. **Do This First** — the session OPENS with the learner doing something real and
   seeing the result. Concrete, runnable, on real tools with shipped test data.
   Include login links. Add any safety/cost warning the domain needs.
2. **What Just Happened** — two or three lines explaining the result they just saw.
   The result teaches the concept; this names it. Bold the key terms. Never a wall
   of text, never theory before the doing.
3. **Why It Matters** — one short paragraph, tied to their running example.
4. **Key Tradeoff** — the honest "this vs that"; when NOT to use it counts too.
5. **Apply to Your Work** — update the relevant line in `MY_<THING>.md`, tying the
   session's concept to the learner's running example.
6. **Check bank** — a handful of "predict what happens, then run it and check"
   prompts the instructor can draw from. Light, rare, hands-on — not recall drills.

Keep it practical and short. Concepts ground out in the running example and the
source material, never abstract theory for its own sake.

## CLAUDE.md — the instructor

Must contain these sections:

- **First-run setup flow** (when `user.json` is missing): ask, one question at a
  time, for the learner's name, role, relevant background, and — most important —
  a rich capture of their **running example** (a concrete recent instance, its
  inputs, its output, where it's slow/weak today) plus a 1–5 self-rating that
  calibrates depth. Then create `user.json` and copy the other three templates to
  the course root. Play the captured example back and confirm before starting.
- **Session execution sequence**: load `user.json` → load the lesson from
  `LESSONS.md` → check `progress.json` → state the objective in one sentence →
  guide exercises step-by-step, **one step then wait for the learner to paste what
  they saw** → discuss → do "Apply to Your Work" → run the quiz → update
  `progress.json` and `PROGRESS.md`.
- **Recognized commands**: "Let's do Session X", "Continue my course", "Show my
  progress", "What's next?", "I'm stuck on X".
- **Quiz rules** (see below).
- **Personalize every exercise** rule: once `user.json` exists, rewrite each
  exercise around the learner's real running example; the generic prompts in
  `LESSONS.md` are fallbacks only.
- **Guardrails**: any domain-specific cost/safety rules to enforce in exercises.
- **Teaching philosophy**: hands-on over lecture; proceed deliberately; stay
  concise; ground everything in the running example; surface tradeoffs; knowing
  when NOT to use a thing is a first-class goal.
- **Delivery style**: concise and fun with a wry, understated British sense of
  humour — take the mickey out of things that go wrong, never earnest corporate
  tone. A few lines per turn, max; one idea at a time. Doing before telling,
  always. Never show code — describe what things do in plain English. Anything
  paste-able goes in a fenced code block, personalized. Use AskUserQuestion for
  interviews and checks when available.

## Check rules (copy into every CLAUDE.md)

Checks are rare and light — not an exam at the end of every session:
- Prefer **"predict, then run, then compare"**: the learner says what they expect,
  runs the real thing, and reconciles the difference. The gap is the lesson.
- One or two checks per session, woven into the doing — never a quiz block.
- Draw from the session's **Check bank** in `LESSONS.md` (adapt freely to the
  learner's running example).
- If the AskUserQuestion tool is available, use it for the predict step.
- Note the outcome in `progress.json` and `PROGRESS.md` (e.g. "Checks: predicted
  Flash cheaper, confirmed").

## Tracking files

- **user.json** — name, role, background, the running-example capture, comfort
  rating, created date. Name the personalization fields after the running example.
- **progress.json** — one entry per session with `status`
  (`not_started`/`in_progress`/`completed`), `checkpoints`, `quiz_score`,
  `notes`, plus a top-level `current_session`.
- **PROGRESS.md** — checkmark view grouped by phase, with quiz scores.
- **MY_<THING>.md** — starts as the learner's running example; gains a line per
  session showing how that session's concept applies; ends as the capstone artifact.

## Personalization (the spine)

The single most important quality bar: the course must make sense **using the
learner's own example**. Capture it richly at setup, store it in `user.json` and
`MY_<THING>.md`, and have the instructor run every exercise on it. A course whose
exercises are generic toys is a failure of this skill.

## Quality bar / definition of done

- Self-contained folder; nothing unrelated modified.
- `LESSONS.md` has **full** content for **every** session (no "TODO"/stubs).
- Final session is a **capstone** that ships the learner's running example.
- All four templates present and internally consistent (session count matches
  across `progress.json`, `PROGRESS.md`, `LESSONS.md`, `README.md`).
- JSON validates.
- The instructor `CLAUDE.md` contains all required sections above.
